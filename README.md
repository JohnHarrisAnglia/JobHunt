# JobHunt

This project is mainly for learning but will be built in a professional way and is going to be a tool to manage my job search.
As its for learning ill be using Vue and .NET Core as I dont have much experince with these at the moment.

Ive been using mainly Angular and .NET/MVC for the past 5/6 years.

Ill be doing a Jira or Trello board for the App after the initial setup of maybe a basic page pulling data from azure and maybe some auth.

I have multiple other things to be doing during the day so im expecting to be working on this between 5:30-8/9pm over the next week at least for you to view my code and how I work. So expect updates in the evening for the morning!
